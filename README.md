This repo is just my attempt to **practice / learn** about Python, tkinter, and GitHub.

Feature:
1. Editable separate dictionary for hidden words ('dicti.txt').
1. Generated input buttons to avoid user input mistakes.
1. Used the heart-shaped pink unicode character (U+2665) to mask the word!
1. My doodle masterpiece in GIMP with mouse for the image!
